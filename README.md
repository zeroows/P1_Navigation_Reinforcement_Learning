# Project 1: Navigation

### Introduction

In this project, you will be training an agent to collect bananas!.  

- **+1** reward for collecting a yellow banana, 
- **-1** penalty for collecting a blue banana.

So, the agent will try to maxumize the reward it collects (more yellow bananas and less blue bananas).

The state size is `37` dimensions and `4` discrete actions:
- **`0`** - move forward.
- **`1`** - move backward.
- **`2`** - turn left.
- **`3`** - turn right.
